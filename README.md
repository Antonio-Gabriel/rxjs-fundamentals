# RxJS Fundamentals

This respository contains the exercises and sample applications used in [Steve's](https://twitter.com/stevekinney) RxJS Fundamentals course for [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com).

## Getting Started

There are three major components to this repository.

- Sample applications: `npm start`.
- API: `npm run api`.
- Tests: `npm test`.

Alternatively you can spin up both the sample applications and the server at the same time using `npm run both`.
